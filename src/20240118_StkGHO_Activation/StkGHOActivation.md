## Simple Summary

This AIP activates the new GHO based Safety module by initiating the emission schedule approved by the community during the vote 
https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x4bc99a842adab6cdd8c7d5c7a787ee4c0056be554fde0d008d53b45b3e795065

## Motivation

The GHO Safety Module will fortify the Aave Protocol’s resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversifies the Safety Module’s capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.

## Specification

The GHO Safety module will be activated with the following parameters:

Base emission: 50 AAVE/day
Duration: Three months
